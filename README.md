# PhysioLabXR Package for Unity
The PhysioLabXR Plugin provides seamless integration of [LSL (Lab Streaming Layer)](https://labstreaminglayer.readthedocs.io/info/intro.html), 
[ZMQ (ZeroMQ)](https://zeromq.org/), and [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) communication 
protocols into Unity projects. This enables Unity developers to easily send and receive data, and call remote procedural calls (RPCs)
between Unity and the PhysioLabXR environment, facilitating real-time, multi-modal, brain-computer interfaces, and extended reality experiments.

## Features
LSL Support: Stream and receive real-time data with Lab Streaming Layer, perfect for neurofeedback and BCI applications.
ZMQ Integration: Use ZeroMQ for high-performance asynchronous messaging in distributed or concurrent applications.
gRPC Communication: Implement efficient, low-latency remote procedure calls (RPCs) with gRPC, ideal for scalable microservices and cloud-based apps.

## How to edit the plugin
1. Clone the repo, and open it in Unity.
2. To edit the sample scenes, rename 'sample'
